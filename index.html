      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Please Buy My Pens (PBMP) began as a small, and I mean a very small business of only one person who was going broke and needed money fast. So, they came up with this side hustle of selling pens. Since then, PBMP has sold a total of 3 pens. Don’t let that number fool you, I plan to sell more. And what better way to sell them than on this website! Are the pens mine? Don't worry about that! That doesn’t matter when you need a pen to write with. You need one, I got one.

              <h3>Blue Pens</h3>
                  <p>Blue pens are classic. Everybody loves them and uses them. You can go right with a trusty blue pen. This blue pen is 100% manufactured by me and not anybody else. The pen doesn’t smear ink anywhere. The pen is built like a cylinder and it’s kind of an awkward shape to hold and write with. Sometimes it can slip out of your hands. Ink lasts for what seems like forever. Very smooth writing. Overall, very nice pen.</p>
