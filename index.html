        <h1>Please Buy My Pens</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Please Buy My Pens (PBMP) began as a small, and I mean a very small business of only one person who was going broke and needed money fast. So, they came up with this side hustle of selling pens. Since then, PBMP has sold a total of 3 pens. Don’t let that number fool you, I plan to sell more. And what better way to sell them than on this website! Are the pens mine? Don't worry about that! That doesn’t matter when you need a pen to write with. You need one, I got one.

            <p>Welcome to Please Buy My Pens! Please do consider buying them. They're... decent quality.</p>

            <h2>Product Descriptions With Photos</h2>
              <h3>Blue Pens</h3>
                  <p>Blue pens are classic. Everybody loves them and uses them. You can go right with a trusty blue pen. This blue pen is 100% manufactured by me and not anybody else. The pen doesn’t smear ink anywhere. The pen is built like a cylinder and it’s kind of an awkward shape to hold and write with. Sometimes it can slip out of your hands. Ink lasts for what seems like forever. Very smooth writing. Overall, very nice pen.</p>

                          <h3>Black Pens</h3>
                            <p>Black pens are also a classic. Many people prefer color though, but that’s not a necessity. The black pens work just as good. These ones specifically write very smooth and flow like water out the pen. Because it’s so smooth, sometimes the ink will smudge on the paper or on your hand and it can run out fast. There’s a small grip area for your finger so that they don’t slip. Overall, very nice pen to write fast with. </p>

                                <h3>Red Pens</h3>
                                  <p>Nobody uses red pens anymore. The last time I remember somebody using them was my teacher when she marked about 3/4th’s of my math exam that I failed. But you know what can get you into red pens? This one specifically! The ink runs smoothly just like the black pens and it also has a grip area for your finger so that they don’t slip. The grip even has lines too so it’s fancier. Overall, very underrated product.</p>

          <h2>Pricing Information</h2>
            <p>Here is a list of our prices. Very cheap and affordable so there shouldn’t be any excuses. Please note, red pens are cheaper because I haven’t seen anybody ever use them. I figured they must be unlikable. All prices are in Canadian dollars. Convert the money yourself.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>This one time, I needed pens so badly to write a story. I came across this extremely sketchy website that was selling pens for cheap. I figured it had to be a scam but it wasn’t! I actually had gotten my pens! I was able to write my story, which turned out to be a New York Times Bestseller. I cannot thank these pens enough! </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>I use the red pen all the time! The quality is outstanding, and the ink never runs out. I feel like i can use it for days on end! It’s super smooth when I write a huge “X” on my student’s math problems that they always get wrong because I’m super tough on them for no reason! It’s perfect. I love seeing their faces when they see the bold, big, red X. I think they get excited about the pens too!</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>If I’m being honest, I’m just the friend of the person who runs this business and they begged me to write a review. I didn’t even buy a pen but they said to pretend like I did. Keep in mind, I’m not getting paid for this. I think my friend, the owner of this business is going crazy. But she’s really nice, so for promotion, you guys should seriously check out her pens! I heard they run smoothly and the other 2 reviews think the same too!</p>
